The goal of this project is to create a minecraft mod that allows me to continue to practice concepts learned in my Java classes.
The project is a constant WIP

I am currently working on:
- Creating Blocks
- Creating Items
- Creating food with its own stats and abilities
- Implementing Creative Tab and items
